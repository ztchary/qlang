# Q is cool

So this language is designed to be everything i wish i could have in a language:

- Statically typed
- Inline assembly (not a string literal)
- Errors as values
- Explicit returns
- Functions and procedures (one returns output, one modifies inputs)
- Best standard lib ever (probably cant deliver on that)
- Fast compiler (ofc)
- No classes (thats too high level)
- Clean syntax (no :=)

I've gotten about 0% of the compiler done and want to work on this in the future but idk if ill get all the features i want.
